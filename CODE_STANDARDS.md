# Code Standards

This document outlines the coding standards to follow when contributing to **Project Clean Code**.

## General Rules
- Write meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused. Each function should do one thing and do it well.
- Follow consistent indenting and formatting styles.
- Prioritize security best practices, including input validation and error handling.

## Language-Specific Standards
- **JavaScript**: Use `let` and `const` instead of `var`.
- **TypeScript**: Use type annotations and interfaces for improved type safety.
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 for styling and best practices.
- **Java**: Use camelCase for variable names and method names. Prefer `@Override` and `@NotNull` annotations where applicable.

## Comments and Documentation
- Document your code using comments where necessary and maintain up-to-date documentation.
- Use docstrings for complex functions and classes.
